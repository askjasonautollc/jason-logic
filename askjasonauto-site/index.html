    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">Jason and Pablo built Ask Jason Auto with one mission: end the chaos and confusion that everyday people face when buying, selling, or flipping used cars. No gimmicks, no dealership pressure, no guessing games‚Äîjust real talk, proven plays, and grounded logic that put control back in the hands of the driver.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">Together, they saw the auto world for what it really was: a minefield of shady listings, overpriced repairs, and hustlers banking on your lack of knowledge. They weren‚Äôt having it. So they built something better‚Äîa no-BS playbook for the street-smart buyer, seller, and flipper.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">Jason brings the hands-on grit: a 30+ year veteran tech, shop owner, and seasoned flipper who‚Äôs turned rust buckets into reliable rides and lemons into cash cows. He speaks with blunt precision, backed by busted knuckles and rebuilt motors. Pablo, with over 40 years in the industry, saw the bigger picture: the need to turn Jason‚Äôs gut instincts and back-lot wisdom into tools, tech, and frameworks anyone could use, anytime, from anywhere.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">Both are also retired U.S. Army combat veterans. That background shapes everything they do: accountability, integrity, and a mission-first mindset built on real sacrifice and hard-earned discipline. When they say no BS, they mean it. Their values were forged under fire‚Äîand now, they apply that same toughness, precision, and honor to the auto world.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">Ask Jason Auto isn‚Äôt about being flashy. It‚Äôs about being right. It cuts through hype and rebuilds confidence. Every answer, checklist, or strategy it gives is designed to strip the emotion, see the deal clearly, and make your next move the right one. Because in the used car world, hesitation costs, and bad info burns fast.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">The core mission? Make the used car market make sense again. Jason and Pablo aren‚Äôt here to sell you a car. They‚Äôre here to help you outsmart the guy who is. That means showing you how to inspect like a mechanic, negotiate like a flipper, and walk like a boss when the deal smells off.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">It also means accountability. Jason doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat. If your plan is garbage, he‚Äôll tell you. If the car you want is a trap, he‚Äôll flag it. If you‚Äôre missing something obvious, he‚Äôll call it out. That kind of honesty is rare in auto spaces built on commissions, ads, and ego. But Jason and Pablo built this platform for power, not profit. The kind of power that lets a single mom out-deal a lot lizard, or a first-time flipper turn a $1,200 buy into $4K clear in under a month.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 accent">Ask Jason Auto is built on four pillars:</h2>

    <div class="space-y-6 mt-4">
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold highlight">1. Inspection Before Emotion</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300">Every good deal starts with a cold look at facts. Condition over color. Frame over features. You‚Äôll learn to spot rust in the shadows, smell coolant before the engine light screams, and feel a worn suspension before you‚Äôre $800 deep in repairs. The system teaches real-world triage, walkaway signs, and simple tests anyone can run without a lift or a tech degree.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold highlight">2. Street-Level Math</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300">Forget blue book nonsense. Jason‚Äôs stack math tracks parts, labor, flip value, and real-world comps to the street. That means knowing what a Civic sells for on Craigslist with 180K and a cracked bumper‚Äînot what some app thinks. It‚Äôs practical, market-tied logic that shows you how to profit, not just "get a deal."</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold highlight">3. Strategy Per Role</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300">Flipping a ride? Selling a daily? Hunting a family hauler? Every move is different. Ask Jason Auto locks in your intent first‚Äîbuyer, seller, or flipper‚Äîthen tailors every play from there. No generic advice. Just hyper-specific steps based on who you are, what you‚Äôre doing, and how fast you want to move.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold highlight">4. No BS, Ever</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300">No fluff. No fake urgency. No ‚Äúact now‚Äù hype. The answers here are sharp, short, and proven. Jason doesn‚Äôt need you to like him‚Äîhe needs you to win. That‚Äôs the difference. That‚Äôs the brand.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mt-6">This mission lives in every evaluation Jason does, every breakdown he writes, every time he tells someone to walk, talk, or run. It‚Äôs not about being right all the time. It‚Äôs about building instincts, confidence, and clear paths through messy, real-world deals.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">Jason and Pablo believe that with the right info and a fearless mindset, anyone can beat the game. You don‚Äôt need to be a mechanic. You don‚Äôt need a dealer license. You just need Jason in your corner.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">Ask Jason Auto is more than a brand. It‚Äôs a movement for people who want control, clarity, and confidence in one of the most chaotic markets out there. It‚Äôs the rebellion against overpriced shops, shady lot sharks, and overpriced fluff.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">Jason and Pablo are building tools, tech, and community to change the way people deal with cars forever. Every message, product, and piece of content is forged from the same mission: empower people with hard math, real talk, and killer instincts.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 font-bold">If you want truth over trends, clarity over clutter, and leverage instead of luck, you‚Äôre in the right garage.</p>

    <p class="text-xl mt-4 highlight text-center">This is Ask Jason Auto. <br>This is how you win the deal. <br>This is just the start.</p>
